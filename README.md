Read the MBR data

- It works fine if you have windows.h library and of course, a compiler!
- It just contains main.cpp
- Use CreateFile to have a handle to your drive.
- PhysicalDrive0, PhysicalDrive1 if you have two hard drives LOL xD
- You should see a file called Binary.bin in your executable directory.

Is it a good idea to read the MBR data, and put it into a file?
```
For Dev-Cpp, visual studio or...
```
